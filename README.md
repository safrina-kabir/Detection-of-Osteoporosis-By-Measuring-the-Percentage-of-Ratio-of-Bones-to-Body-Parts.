# Detection-of-Osteoporosis-By-Measuring-the-Percentage-of-Ratio-of-Bones-to-Body-Parts.
The primary objective of our project is to develop a system capable of detecting osteoporosis and fractures in X-ray images. Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by decreased bone
density, making bones fragile and prone to fractures. We utilize image processing techniques to assess the bone-to-body ratio percentage, which serves as an indicator of bone density.

## Working Procedure:
The working procedure of our project involves two primary targets: the detection of osteoporosis and the identification of fractures in X-ray images. For osteoporosis detection, we initially preprocess the X-ray image by converting it to grayscale and applying binarization techniques to isolate bone areas. Subsequently, we calculate the percentage of bone area relative to the total
area and compare it with a predefined threshold to determine the presence of osteoporosis. Fracture detection entails edge detection using the Canny algorithm, followed by edge refinement and fracture identification based on the size and distribution of connected components. The percentage of fractured bone is computed and compared with a threshold to ascertain the presence of fractures. Through these systematic steps, our project aims to provide accurate and timely diagnosis of osteoporosis and fractures, enabling prompt medical intervention and improved patient care.

## Concusion
Our project successfully achieves the objectives of detecting osteoporosis and fractures in X-ray
images using image processing techniques. Early detection of these conditions can facilitate
timely medical intervention and improve patient outcomes. Further enhancements and validation
are recommended to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the system.
